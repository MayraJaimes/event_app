# event_app

Welcome to Eventful - a desktop and mobile solution for your event planning needs.

This app uses Node.js and Express to bring this experience to you. Our authentification is powered by passport for Express. We use MYSQL and Sequelize to store event data for each user. Additionally, Express Handlebars is used to render event data on the front end. Finally, the app is live and deployed on Heroku at https://afternoon-oasis-27882.herokuapp.com/.

First you are taken to the homepage rendered with Bootstrap. From here you have the option to create an account or login - fill out the form prompts to sign in.

Next, you are taken to the home page with all your events listed. You can create a new event or edit old ones by clicking on them.

In each event, you can add items needed or guests that will be attending the event. You can delete guests or mark items as checked off to keep track of your event.

Lastly, this website is mobile responsive and should work and display on your mobile device.

Start planning your next event today!
